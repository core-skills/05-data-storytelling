## Choosing Good Visualisations

| 30 mins |

### Design in Visualisation

**Communication**

* Make discrete arguments with visualisations
* Build visualisations to tell stories

**Cognitive load**

* Effort required to absorb the information

**Data to Ink Ratio**

* Declutter your plot
* Complicated visuals are not conducive to telling stories,
  your audience won't know where to look. Start simple and
  highlight important features.
* If something is visually complicated, it may seem difficult
  to understand - your audience are less likely to try.

### Plot Types


### Gestalt Principles: Structure in Visualisations

* Proximity
* Similarity
* Enclosure
* Closure
* Continuity
* Connection


### Attention and Memory

| :question: What happens in the brain? |
| ------------------------------------- |

**Iconic Memory**

The things you notice before you notice things (pre-attentive).

**Short Term Memory**

Low-capacity, but longer term. You can keep a few things in mind.

* Three to five items.
* Chunk the information.

**Long Term Memory**

Visual and verbal memory. Not typically in use with regard to visualisation,
but can be used to integrate external/bigger picture elements (e.g. via
images, phrases).

### Pre-attentive Visual Properties

Pre-attentive visual properties are processed in memory without conscious action,
meaning they can be used (or abused) to enhance some aspect of the data visualisation
without effort from the audience. These properties include colour, form, spatial
position and motion.

Colour:
* Hue
* Intensity

Form:
* Orientation and co-linearity
* Shape
* Line length
* Size and width
* Curvature
* Added marks
* Enclosure

**Spatial position**
* Grouping or spatial associativity
* Connection

**Motion**

Choose which pre-attentive signals to use, and ideally pick a small number
to enhance aspects directly related to your story.

Note that most of these also work for text. Also consider the typical reading
order of a figure which is not bounded will be akin to reading of a page of text
(from right to left and then down, in the Western world).

Be aware that some colours and symbols may have cultural annotations.

### Aesthetics

| :question: What makes a plot look nice? |
| --------------------------------------- |

| :question: What makes a plot useful? |
| ------------------------------------ |

Time spent making visualisations aesthetically pleasing can be time well spent,
especially if it's at the centre of your audience's attention.

Design elements should all be intentional and used sparingly.

Alignment and symmetry are also important aspects.

White space is important.

If you aren't particularly comfortable with visual design, find something
you find appealing, deconstruct the design, and perhaps and attempt to replicate it.

## Affordance

Let the audience know why the information is useful to them, and how they can
use it.
