# Stories from Data

## Understanding Context

| 20 mins |
| ------- |

| Who are you talking to?             |
| ----------------------------------- |
| :question: Who is your audience?    |
| :question: Who are you to them?     |
| :question: What is the environment? |

The more specifically you can define your audience the better. If you're
speaking to motivate a few specific people, it's more likely that you'll
be able to convince them to do something.

If you have an established relationship, you can often get to the point quicker.
Otherwise, you might want to spend more time on explanation to build trust.

| What do you want out of this?                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What do you want the audience to know?       |
| :question: What do you want them to do?                 |
| :question: How does authority/seniority play into this? |

You don't need to take the audience through the entire exploration you
have to reach your conclusion, but it's good to explain the key points.

|                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: In what form could you communicate your message to the audience? |
| :question: What tone is appropriate for the audience?                       |

There's a continuum between live presentations and written communication,
but you typically end up at either end.

Avoid 'slideuments'!

| Establishing some context:                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What data is available to support your point?                                                        |
| :question: What background information is relevant or essential?                                                |
| :question: Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them?                                   |
| :question: What biases do our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant?                    |
| :question: Is our audience familiar with this data or is it new?                                                |
| :question: 	What are the risks? What factors could weaken our case, and do we need to proactively address them? |
| :question: What would a successful outcome look like?                                                           |
| :question: What's your one-liner overview?                                                                      |

### Three Minute Story

When you have an idea or message to convey,
you want to boil it down to the core essence,
and present it in the simplest, most direct form.

There are many names for this process or idea (e.g. "elevator pitch), but essentially what we want to do is turn our 'so what' into a paragraph which can be presented in just a few minutes.

This is handy when you are given the time to present it in full, but increasingly time is at a premium and we may want to restrict it even more...

### Big Ideas

If you don't have three minutes, but you have a moment, how would you convey your story?

Here we'll take our paragraph down our a single *message* which fits in a single sentence. Nancy Duarte, in her book *Resonate*<sup>[#](#f1)</sup> describes the key features of this message:

* It must articulate your unique point of view.
* It must convey what's at stake.
* It must be a complete sentence.

Additionally, we'd add:
* The shorter the better.
* Where relevant, make it personal.

For example, rather than a message which is summarised as "Lunar Mission", use "The United States should lead in space
achievement, because it holds the key to *our* future on Earth."

## Telling Good Stories

| 20 mins |
| ------- |

**Facts a story maketh not.**

**Facts don't win friends.**

### Structure of a Narrative

Classically, this could be considered in terms of dramatic structure with
a **setup**, **conflict** and **resolution** (à la Aristotle:
"A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" ).

|                | :question: What does this look like for us?                               |
| --------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      **Setup** | *The setting*: when, where and who?                                       |
|   **Conflict** | *The imbalance*: why is it necessary, what has changed?                   |
|                | *The balance*: what do you want to see happen?                            |
| **Resolution** | *The solution*: how will you bring about the changes? The call to action. |

Make sure you frame these in terms of your audience!

### Developing Storyboards

1.	Checking structure through headlines (horizontal logic)
2.	Making sure everything in a view is supportive (vertical logic)
3.	Reverse storyboarding final product (start with headlines)
4.	Edit ruthlessly – keep it simple – be authentic
5.	Get a second opinion!

### Storyboarding

One way of constructing narratives
Breakdown your story onto post-its, and arrange them on a whiteboard/desk/window.

## Choosing Good Visualisations

| 30 mins |
| ------- |

### Design in Visualisation

**Communication**

* Make discrete arguments with visualisations
* Build visualisations to tell stories

**Cognitive load**

* Effort required to absorb the information

**Data to Ink Ratio**

* Declutter your plot
* Complicated visuals are not conducive to telling stories,
  your audience won't know where to look. Start simple and
  highlight important features.
* If something is visually complicated, it may seem difficult
  to understand - your audience are less likely to try.

### Plot Types

There are some things which humans are good at distinguishing, and some things
which we're not good at. While we can easily discern length and width,
relationships to area and volume are secondary. For this reason, area-based charts
like pie or donuts may not work well.

When it comes to 3D plots, consider whether you need this aspect, or if you
could effectively visualise the same thing in 2D - simply due to the need for
effective depth perception to understand what's being presented (which isn't
easily achieved on a 2D screen).

Auxiliary or secondary axes also typically over-complicate figures.
Consider making separate/linked plots, or labelling items directly (e.g for lines).

### Gestalt Principles: Structure in Visualisations

"Gestalt" follows from the German for form or shape. In psychology and design, it's
used to refer to patterns or configuration.

The "Gestalt Principles" provide a framework for explaining why we see things the
way we do, and in particular how we perceive the ordering of things. The principles
include:

* Proximity
* Similarity
* Enclosure
* Closure
* Continuity
* Connection

### Attention and Memory

| :question: What happens in the brain? |
| ------------------------------------- |

**Iconic Memory**

The things you notice before you notice things (pre-attentive).

**Short Term Memory**

Low-capacity, but longer term. You can keep a few things in mind.

* Three to five items.
* Chunk the information.

**Long Term Memory**

Visual and verbal memory. Not typically in use with regard to visualisation,
but can be used to integrate external/bigger picture elements (e.g. via
images, phrases).

### Pre-attentive Visual Properties

Pre-attentive visual properties are processed in memory without conscious action,
meaning they can be used (or abused) to enhance some aspect of the data visualisation
without effort from the audience. These properties include colour, form, spatial
position and motion.

**Colour**
* Hue
* Intensity

**Form**
* Orientation and co-linearity
* Shape
* Line length
* Size and width
* Curvature
* Added marks
* Enclosure

**Spatial position**
* Grouping or spatial associativity
* Connection

**Motion**

Choose which pre-attentive signals to use, and ideally pick a small number
to enhance aspects directly related to your story.

Note that most of these also work for text. Also consider the typical reading
order of a figure which is not bounded will be akin to reading of a page of text
(from right to left and then down, in the Western world).

Be aware that some colours and symbols may have cultural annotations.

### Aesthetics

| :question: What makes a plot look nice? |
| --------------------------------------- |

| :question: What makes a plot useful? |
| ------------------------------------ |

Time spent making visualisations aesthetically pleasing can be time well spent,
especially if it's at the centre of your audience's attention.

Design elements should all be intentional and used sparingly.

Alignment and symmetry are also important aspects.

White space is important.

If you aren't particularly comfortable with visual design, find something
you find appealing, deconstruct the design, and perhaps and attempt to replicate it.

## Affordance

Let the audience know why the information is useful to them, and how they can
use it.
