# Journalistic Data Stories

| 30-45 mins |
| ---------- |

This session we'll be interrogating some data stories produced by journalists and
professionals to pull apart the design elements. We'll work through a framework
to ask questions about the aims, subtexts and execution of these
stories to understand how the techniques we've been talking about have been used.

|               | How has the story been put together?                                                        |
| -------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Context** | :question: How have the authors identified                                                  |
| **Structure** | :question: How is the story structured?                                                     |
|               | :question: Is the takeaway up front? 	Or does it get revealed gradually?                    |
|               | :question: Have the authors used a setup/conflict/resolution structure?                     |
|               | :question: If not, if so, how are they using tension or conflict to maintain your interest? |
| **Narrative** | :question: How have the authors made the data personal or relevant for their audience?      |
|               | :question: What techniques have they used to make the narrative memorable?                  |

Considering at least one of the data visualisations, run through a few questions
to pull it apart:

| Data Visualisation Interrogation                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: How do the team walk readers through the story in this data viz?                                                                                                                              |
| :question: How do they provide structure to the data (e.g. consider <a id="a1">[Gestalt principles](#f1 "Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Continuity, Connection")</a> )?                      |
| :question: How do they focus the audience's attention (e.g. consider <a id="a2">[pre-attentive attributes](#f2 "Orientation, Colour, Size, Curvature or Added Marks, Intensity, Location, Motion")</a>)? |
| :question: Do they use affordances for the audience to interact with the data?                                                                                                                           |

Come up with a three minute story and a big idea for the visualisation you've just ran through.

<b id="f1">Gestalt principles</b>: Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Continuity, Connection. [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">Pre-attentive attributes</b>: Orientation, Colour, Size, Curvature or Added Marks, Intensity, Location, Motion. [↩](#a2)

## Share What You've Found

| 30 mins |
| ------- |

We have some time to go through what you've found.

|                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What works well?                                                |
| :question: What are elements which were redundant or confused the message? |

Get together into a few groups for after lunch, where we'll be developing some
storyboards around risk reduction.
