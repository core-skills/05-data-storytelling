# Journalistic Data Stories

| 30-45 mins |
| ---------- |

In this session we'll be interrogating some data-driven articles produced by journalists,
professional storytellers and designers with the aim of understanding how design elements discussed this morning effectively tell a story.

We'll work through the framework outlined below to ask questions about the aims, subtexts and execution of these stories to understand how the techniques we've been talking about have (or haven't) been used.

## Deep reading of a professional story

| 20 mins |
| ------- |

:heavy_exclamation_mark: You will be sharing your thoughts back with the class:
1.	Come up with three bullet points (for setup, conflict and resolution) and a ‘big idea’ sentence for this story to summarize it for everyone else.
2.	Give one example of good use of technical elements (structure, design, visualisation or narrative), and one example where you thought the authors could improve.


Spend a few minutes reading through the story and have a play with any interactive visualisations.

- What do you like about the story?
- Does it change your mind on the issues that are raised?
- Did you learn anything new?

Take a deeper look at the strategies the authors have used to tell their story. Describe how the storytelling team have used the following:

|               | Questions to investigate how the story has been put together                                |
| -------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Context** | :question: How have the authors identified their audience?                                  |
|               | :question: What knowledge do they assume the readers know, what new concepts are they going to introduce?|
| **Structure** | :question: How is the story structured?                                                     |
|               | :question: Is the takeaway up front? 	Or does it get revealed gradually?                    |
|               | :question: Have the authors used a setup/conflict/resolution structure the narrative?       |
|               | :question: If not, if so, how are they using tension or conflict to maintain your interest? |
| **Narrative** | :question: How have the authors made the data personal or relevant for their audience?      |
|               | :question: What techniques have they used to make the narrative memorable?                  |

Considering at least one of the data visualisations, run through a few questions
to pull it apart:

| Data Visualisation Interrogation                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: How do the team walk readers through the story in this data viz?                                                                                                                              |
| :question: How do they provide structure to the data (e.g. consider <a id="a1">[Gestalt principles](#f1 "Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Continuity, Connection")</a> )?                      |
| :question: How do they focus the audience's attention (e.g. consider <a id="a2">[pre-attentive attributes](#f2 "Orientation, Colour, Size, Curvature or Added Marks, Intensity, Location, Motion")</a>)? |
| :question: If interactive, how do they use *design affordances* for the audience to interact with the data?                                                                                                                           |

<b id="f1">Gestalt principles</b>: Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Continuity, Connection. [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">Pre-attentive attributes</b>: Orientation, Colour, Size, Curvature or Added Marks, Intensity, Location, Motion. [↩](#a2)

 :question: What works well?                                                

 :question: What are elements which were redundant or confused the message? 

## Share What You've Found

### Small groups

| 10 mins |
| ------- |

Pair up with people that have the same story as you and share your bullet points and good/bad examples. Summarize these takeaways to share with the group in three minutes or less. Elect a person to convey your collective takeaways to the group.

### To everyone

| 10 mins |
| ------- |


Share 3-minute story summaries

:triangular_flag_on_post: Get together into a few groups for after lunch, where we'll be developing some
storyboards around risk reduction.
