## Putting Together a Data-Driven Storyboard

This afternoon you'll be developing a storyboard for your capstone to develop a
narrative around the problem you're tackling, the impact it has, how you might
go about solving it, and the likely benefits or value it might deliver.

Note that you'll be giving a capstone overview in a few weeks where this might come in
handy - and also a final capstone pitch which might heavily use what you generate this
afternoon, so consider it a useful investment (even if it's not yet polished..). You
will have between 90 and 120 minutes to complete your storyboard. With that in mind,
we suggest the following use of your time:

1. Spend the first **15 mins** identifying your context:
  * Who are your audience?
  * How will we make this data relevant to them?
  * What actions are we wanting them to take?

2. Spend the next **30 mins** developing your message:
  * What is the story you are trying to tell?
  * How will you use data and data viz to support this story?
  * At the end of this 45 minutes you should come up with:
    *	a three-minute pitch, and
    * a big-idea sentence for your story.

3. Develop a storyboard for your story and some demo data visualization (**30 mins**).
  * Aim for five minutes total presentation time.
  * For the storyboard, think about your narrative structure
    * How will you engage the audience emotionally?
  * Equally, think about potential ethical concerns and how your presentation may be *perceived*
    * Are there privacy concerns?
    * Will people be adversely affected by your presentation?
    * Does your presentation potentially impact someone's employment?
  * For the data visualisation – think about using the design principles from this
    morning to deliver an aesthetically pleasing but effective approach.
    * How will you focus your audience’s attention?
    * Have you removed everything except the important aspects?
