## Asking Useful Questions

## Putting Together a Data-Driven Storyboard

You have been tasked with creating a story using data to highlight the most
effective risk reduction strategies that people can take to reduce fatal
incidents while at work. People are not good at assessing risk objectively â€“
can we help them calibrate their risk detectors with a good data story?

Some starting data to be used:
* [SafewWorkAustralia](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/resources_publications/statistical-tables)
* [Worksafe WA](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/work-related-fatalities)
* *or*, anything else you can find (e.g. [data.gov.au](data.gov.au),
  [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/)).

How might ethics play a part in how you present this? Will people be adversely affected
by your presentation?

**Objectives**:

1. Identify your audience and context:
   * Who are we talking to?
   * How will we make this data relevant to them?
   * What actions are we wanting them to take?

2. Come up with an interesting message to tell:
   * Develop a three-minute pitch paragraph, and a Big Idea sentence.

3. Develop a storyboard for your story to share with the class

4. Develop data visualizations as appropriate to support your story
   using the design principles from this morning

We will be sharing these with the rest of the class after afternoon tea,
so be prepared to give us a walkthrough of your storyboard and visualization (~5 mins).

### Worked Example

* Present a worked example as a template for completing the exercise.
* Point out where it could be improved.
