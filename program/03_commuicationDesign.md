## Asking Useful Questions

## Putting Together a Data-Driven Storyboard

You have been tasked with creating a story using data to highlight the most
effective risk reduction strategies that people can take to reduce fatal
incidents while at work. People are not good at assessing risk objectively –
can we help them calibrate their risk detectors with a good data story?

Some starting data to be used:
* [SafewWorkAustralia](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/resources_publications/statistical-tables)
* [Worksafe WA](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/work-related-fatalities)
* *or*, anything else you can find (e.g. [data.gov.au](data.gov.au),
  [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/)).

You will have an hour and a half to complete this exercise.
We will be sharing these with the rest of the class after afternoon tea,
so be prepared to give us a walkthrough of your storyboard and visualization (~5 mins).
You will likely need to spend some time doing a bit of investigative data work – we'd
suggest splitting up into pairs to explore the data for 20 minutes before
sharing with the rest of the group to identify the strongest stories.
We suggest the following use of your time:

1. Spend the first **15 mins** in your team discussing the context:
  * Who are your audience?
  * How will we make this data relevant to them?
  * What actions are we wanting them to take?

2. Spend the next **30 mins** identifying your message:
  * What is the story you are trying to tell?
  * How will you use data and data viz to support this story?
  * At the end of this 45 minutes you should come up with:
    *	a three-minute pitch, and
    * a big-idea sentence for your story.

3. Develop a storyboard for your story and some demo data visualization (**30 mins**).
  * Aim for five minutes total presentation time.
  * For the storyboard, think about your narrative structure
    * How will you engage the audience emotionally?
  * Equally, think about potential ethical concerns
    * How might a person who lost their mate in a work accident feel about your story?
    * Will people be adversely affected by your presentation?
  * For the data visualisation – think about using the design principles from this
    morning to deliver an aesthetically pleasing but effective approach.
    * How will you focus your audience’s attention?
    * Have you removed everything except the important aspects?

### Worked Example

* Present a worked example as a template for completing the exercise.
* Point out where it could be improved.
