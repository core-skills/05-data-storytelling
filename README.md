# Core skills program - week 5 - Telling stories with data

The aim of today's session will be to develop an understanding of the intersection between data and communication – where this works well, where this goes wrong and how to improve the communication from their projects. We'll look at how we can use data to tell compelling stories, change the way people view problems and effectively suggest a course of action.

You should aim to:
- understand avenues for communicating project results beyond the usual dashboard/graphs approach.
- understand the use of design principles to engage your audience and draw their attention
- be able to critique data presentations (both good and bad) in a variety of media
- gain experience at developing your own effective data-driven communication

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

Have a poke around online to find examples of excellent online examples of data-driven storytelling. You should also check out:
- ABC News Data team: https://www.abc.net.au/news/interactives/ Simon Elvery (a member of that team) has a great piece about the process of designing a data driven story about cellphone metadata here: http://www.walkleys.com/nerd-box-how-the-abcs-interactive-team-made-the-creepiness-of-metadata-personal/
- Guardian Data Blog: https://www.theguardian.com/data or the Australian version https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-datablog
- FiveThirtyEight: https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/data-visualization/
- Nathan Yau/FlowingData is a goldmine of good dataviz: https://flowingdata.com
- Moritz Stefaner has some excellent project examples: https://truth-and-beauty.net/
- For an alternative take, check out the NYT R&D group: http://nytlabs.com

We'll cover visualisation and perception briefly in the course. For more details on the science behind how we perceive order and make decisions, take a look at _Thinking Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman: https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555

The grand-daddy of visualisation is Edward Tufte, who was writing about this back in the days of moveable type, rather than electrons. His book _Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative_ is the default text in the field and has arguably influenced more data viz practitioners than anyone else: https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex

Have a look around on the internet for examples of bad visualisation - there are plenty of sites with 'halls of shame'. One good example is
_How to lie with maps_: https://www.ft.com/content/65b5df0e-49ff-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb


**Todo:** add pre-session reading and resources (and _why_ you might like to read them - see [week two's README](https://github.com/core-skills/02-getting-to-know-the-tools/blob/master/README.md) as an example)
